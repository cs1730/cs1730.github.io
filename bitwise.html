<h2>Bit Masks</h2>

<p>In computer science, a <strong>mask</strong> is data that is used for bitwise operations, particularly in a bit field. Using a mask, multiple bits in a variable can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.</p>

<p>To turn certain bits on, the bitwise OR operation can be used, following the principle that Y | 1 = 1 and Y | 0 = Y. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, OR can be used with a 1. To leave a bit unchanged, OR is used with a 0.</p>

<p>Example: Masking "on" the higher bits (bits 4, 5, 6, 7), leaving the lower bits (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged.</p>

<h2>Bit Masks</h2>

<p>In computer science, a <strong>mask</strong> is data that is used for bitwise operations, particularly in a bit field. Using a mask, multiple bits in a variable can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.</p>

<p>To turn certain bits on, the bitwise OR operation can be used, following the principle that Y | 1 = 1 and Y | 0 = Y. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, OR can be used with a 1. To leave a bit unchanged, OR is used with a 0.</p>

<p>Example:

<pre>
    0b1001'0101'1010'0101      0172765      38309      0x95A5
  | 0b1111'0000'1111'0000    | 0170360    | 61680    | 0xF0F0
    ---------------------      -------      -----      ------
  = 0b1111'0101'1111'0101    = 0172765    = 62965    = 0xF5F5
</pre>
